1. Missing Required Attribute: sku_name
Error Message:

The argument "sku_name" is required, but no definition was found.
Cause: The azurerm_service_plan resource requires a sku_name, even for the free (consumption) tier.

Solution: Add the following to the azurerm_service_plan block:
sku_name = "Y1"  # For Linux Consumption Plan

2. Unconfigurable Attribute: kind
Error Message:

Can't configure a value for "kind": its value will be decided automatically...
Cause: Terraform automatically derives the kind of the service plan when os_type is provided.

Solution: Remove this line:

kind = "FunctionApp"
3. Unsupported Block Type: sku
Error Message:

Blocks of type "sku" are not expected here.
Cause: You're using an older format. The latest Terraform Azure provider expects sku_name directly, not inside a sku block.

Solution: Replace:

sku {
  tier = "Dynamic"
  size = "Y1"
}
 With:
sku_name = "Y1"

4. Unconfigurable Attribute: linux_fx_version
Error Message:

Can't configure a value for "site_config.0.linux_fx_version"...
Cause: Terraform Azure Provider v3+ made linux_fx_version read-only in site_config. You must set it under the root-level property.

Solution:Move it out of site_config:

site_config {
  linux_fx_version = "DOCKER|<image>"
}
becomes:

linux_fx_version = "DOCKER|<image>"

5. Variables Not Reflected During Plan
Error Message:

Error: Missing required value for "container_image"
Cause: You defined variables but didnâ€™t include terraform.tfvars file or pass them manually.

Solution: Create terraform.tfvars file:

container_image = "saisivapriya695/simpletimeservice:latest"
Or pass variables manually:

terraform apply -var="container_image=your_image"
